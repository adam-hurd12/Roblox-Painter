# Roblox-Painter
Simple multiplayer game to showcase a custom grid-based item selection and placement system, developed using the Luau scripting language. 

## Overview
*Painting Game* on Roblox is a basic showcase of a fully implemented custom item placement system on a grid. Currently, the items shown are simple colour blocks but can be modularly and easily changed by adding to the 'Items' folder (not shown in repository). Features basic UI and controls to demonstrate the capabilities of such a system. Based on the placement systems seen in games such as [Miner's Haven (Roblox)](https://www.roblox.com/games/258258996/Miners-Haven-Sandbox-Tycoon). The system is fully scalable and an infinite amount of placeables can be added, with no additional code required. All code is held within the src/ folder.

## Key Features
-- Custom item selection and placement system
-- Basic interactive GUI for user experience
-- Fully modular code

## Skills Developed
-- Luau scripting
-- Event-driven programming
-- Basic UI/UX scripting
-- Object-oriented programming, utilising ModuleScripts as classes

## Note
This repository only holds the scripts required to run the placement system. I am currently developing and shipping the entire system as a model / plugin for Roblox Studio, so that others can use it in their projects.
